# Autumn House

A tough tale to tell, I assure you.  I scarcely believe it myself. Never a truer cliche spoken, yeah?

But it's true.  I don't believe in coincidence any longer, too many perfect alignments.  No, things must be as they seem, or I have truly gone mad.  Well, I know I'm mad, but I'm a functioning mad person.  I know what's right and what I care about.  I don't always follow the rules, you see.  Not a reflection of my upbringing, mind you!  I am simply a bad egg.  Thrice bad, if you will.

And then comes the Autumn House. The place you thought you wanted, but it was merely a ruse.  Life is but a ruse, always looking to trick you, for some unknown reason.  Perhaps life is just inherently jealous of you?  Seem plausible.  Maybe.  

Then the wretched, abomnible Autumn House. Blinding us with soothing earthy tones, drawing us in. Allowing things to simply run amock, because, that's just the way its been. Well no, things need to change from time to time.  We don't need to keep having war, or death.  Death comes on its own, we neededn't help him, yeah?

But anyway, I want to get in, but I have to wait, just a few more hours.  I walked for days to get here.  Hopefully it wasn't all for nothing.  I should go fish in the spot I dreamt of.
